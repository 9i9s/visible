# Discord Server Website Creator

Create nice presentable websites for your Discord Servers quickly and easily without having to go through
every text element individually

(Version 1.0.0) - Release

## Getting Started

First fork the repo or download it from Code > Download ZIP or git
by doing the following command:

```git
git clone https://github.com/TropityDan/discord-server-site-creator.git
```

Once you have the files open up `website-config.js` in any text editor.
Here you can configure everything. I will give a breif overview below of what everything does.

* "website-title" - This is the title displayed on the tab on browsers.

* "header-links" - Header links is an object which contains all links at the top of the page. The first value is what is shown
and the second value is the url that leads to. This could be other pages or invite links etc.

* "website-main-text" - This is the main text of the page and can be edited in any way you want.

* "website-main-description" - This is the main description under the main text. This can also be edited in anyway you want.

* "discord-server-name" - This is the name of your Discord Server. It is used as a default value for some things aronund the site!

* "discord-server-invite" - This is the invite for your discord server. It is used for the join server buttons.

* "features" - Features is an object which contains all of the feature cards on the page. The first value is the title of the feature
and the second value is the description of it. **Note you can only have a maximum of 4**

* "discord-server-owner" - This is used for the copyright at the bottom. If you don't want it then you can just leave it blank.

* "statistics" - Statistics is an object which contains all of the statistics of your Discord Server. Such as member count, bot count 
and even your channel count. The first value is what is the title of the card and the second value is the number displayed.
Please also note that **You can only have a maximum of 4 of these too.**

And just like that you have created your very own Discord Server website!
Feel free to play around with it as you want!
